	  <p id="chen2022graph" class="abstract collapse">Understanding the interfacial behaviors of biomolecules is crucial to applications in biomaterials and nanoparticle-based biosensing technologies. In this work, we utilized autoencoder-based graph clustering to analyze discontinuous molecular dynamics (DMD) simulations of lysozyme adsorption on a graphene surface. Our high-throughput DMD simulations integrated with a Go̅-like protein–surface interaction model makes it possible to explore protein adsorption at a large temporal scale with sufficient accuracy. The graph autoencoder extracts a low-dimensional feature vector from a contact map. The sequence of the extracted feature vectors is then clustered, and thus the evolution of the protein molecule structure in the absorption process is segmented into stages. Our study demonstrated that the residue–surface hydrophobic interactions and the π–π stacking interactions play key roles in the five-stage adsorption. Upon adsorption, the tertiary structure of lysozyme collapsed, and the secondary structure was also affected. The folding stages obtained by autoencoder-based graph clustering were consistent with detailed analyses of the protein structure. The combination of machine learning analysis and efficient DMD simulations developed in this work could be an important tool to study biomolecules’ interfacial behaviors.

	  <p id="zhang2022atnnet" class="abstract collapse">Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a heterogeneous, multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder, where beta-amyloid (A), pathologic tau (T), neurodegeneration ([N]), and structural brain network (Net) are four major indicators of AD progression. Most current studies on AD rely on single-source modality and ignore complex biological interactions at molecular level. In this study, we propose a novel multimodal spatiotemporal stratification network (MSSN) that is built upon the fusion of multiple data modalities and the combined power of systems biology and deep learning. Altogether, our stratification approach could (1) ameliorate limitations caused by insufficient longitudinal imaging data, (2) extract important spatiotemporal features vectors from imaging data, (3) exploit the subject-specific longitudinal prediction of a holistic biomarker set, and (4) generate symptoms related finegrained subtype classification.

	  <p id="dong2020adaptive" class="abstract collapse">Nowadays, more and more cloud testing platforms provide enterprise developers with solutions for cloud device debugging and automatic testing. It is a great challenge for these cloud platforms to schedule the arriving requests to run on the specific smart device resources in real-time and efficiently. The traditional scheduling algorithm is difficult to adapt to the application interface call request with a vast difference in volume and behaviour ability. To solve this problem, we integrate these smart devices into a device cloud and propose a measurement method of the service capability of a single device in the group. Then we build an adaptive scheduling algorithm model according to the characteristics of the serviceability of a single device to improve the scheduling efficiency of the group. Practice shows that the adaptive scheduling algorithm can effectively control the network traffic. Finally, through the analysis and optimization, we get the method of obtaining the optimal parameter combination in the algorithm.

	  <p id="liu2019first" class="abstract collapse">Mobile app ecosystem has gained giant success in providing services on mobile devices to facilitate almost all aspects in our daily life. However, the whole-package installation and dramatically increasing package size are now preventing users from trying more apps. To address the issue, many lightweight frameworks have emerged, enabling to provide the experience of instant service consumption where apps are of small size and no installation is needed to consuming services provided by the apps. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study on instant service consumption on mobile devices. We focus on one of the most popular frameworks, quick apps, which are proposed and supported by nine mainstream mobile phone manufacturers in China. Quick apps are implemented with Web-based technologies, and run as native apps without the need of installation. We find that quick apps have much smaller size and only provide a limited set of services compared to their corresponding native apps. Then, we characterize the performance differences between quick apps and native apps in terms of launching time, data drain, and network connections, when the two kinds of apps provide the same services. Our observations reveal that quick apps perform better than native apps thanks to its much smaller size and less functionalities in a single page. Finally, we propose a machine learning based approach to helping developers construct the quick app from an existing native app.

		<p id="xu2022pathology" class="abstract collapse">Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a heterogeneous, multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder characterized by beta-amyloid, pathologic tau, and neurodegeneration. The massive heterogeneity between neurobiological examinations and clinical assessment is the current biggest challenge in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, urging for a comprehensive stratification of the aging population that is defined by reliable neurobiological biomarkers and closely associated with clinical outcomes. However, existing statistical inference approaches in neuroimaging studies of AD subtype identification fail to take into account the neuropathological domain knowledge, which could lead to ill-posed results that are sometimes inconsistent with neurological principles. To fill this knowledge gap, we propose a novel pathology steered stratification network (PSSN) that integrates mainstream AD pathology with multimodal longitudinal neuroimaging data to categorize the aging population. By combining theory-based biological modeling and data-driven deep learning, this cross-disciplinary approach can not only generate long-term biomarker prediction consistent with the end-state of individuals but also stratifies subjects into fine-grained subtypes with distinct neurological underpinnings, where ag-ing brains within the same subtype share com-mon biological behaviors that emerge as similar trajectories of cognitive decline. Our stratification outperforms K-means and SuStaIn in both inter-cluster heterogeneity and intra-cluster homogeneity of various clinical scores. Importantly, we identify six subtypes spanning AD spectrum, where each subtype exhibits a distinctive biomarker pattern that is consistent with its clinical outcome. A disease evolutionary graph is further provided by quantifying subtype transition probabilities, which may assist pre-symptomatic diagnosis and guide therapeutic treatments.
